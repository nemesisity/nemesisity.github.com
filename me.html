Oh Nooo Its Mr. Bill</H1></CENTER>

<H4>I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice.
I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks,
making them more efficient in the area of heat retention.  I
translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees.  I write award-winning
operas.  I manage time efficiently.  Occasionally, I tread water
for three days in a row.  I woo women with my sensuous and godlike
trombone playing.  I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with
unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty
minutes.  I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an
outlaw in Peru.
<P>
Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single
handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde
of ferocious army ants.  I play bluegrass cello.  I was scouted by
the Mets.  I am the subject of numerous documentaries.  When I'm
bored, I build large suspension bridges in my yard. I enjoy urban
hang gliding.  On Wednesdays, I repair electrical appliances free
of charge.
<P>
I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie.  
Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening
wear.  I don't perspire.  I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan
mail.  I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend
passes.  Last summer I toured New Jersey with a traveling
centrifugal-force demonstration.  I bat .400.  My deft floral
arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles.
<P>
I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly
accuracy.  I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David
Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire
dining room table that evening.  I know the exact location of
every food item in the supermarket.  I have performed several
covert operations for the CIA.  I sleep once a week; when I do
sleep, I sleep in a chair.  While on vacation in Canada, I
successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized
a small bakery.  The laws of physics do not apply to me.
<P>
I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid.
On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact
origami.  Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to
write it down.  I have made extraordinary four course meals using
only a mouli and a toaster oven.  I breed prizewinning clams.  I
have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri
Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin.  I have played Hamlet.  I
have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.

<H4> It was an unusually warm on that autumn day, even for Phoenix. It had been just 56 days since we put the first man on the moon.  A baby boy was introduced to this planet we call Earth, on September 14th of the year 1969.  And so it began..............</H4>
<P>
<H4>OK, so I'm not a writer.  Alas, most of the things I write are unintelligible to non-techies.  Yep, you guessed it, another Software Engineer.  But it wasn't always that way.  Lets back up a bit.</H4>
<P>
<H4>
Sure, I wrote my first computer program before the age of 8.  I've always been interested in computers since my first Apple II.  Yet I did find other distractions.  It was in high school that I abandoned computing and pursued a loftier study.  The study of the human mind.  I went all the way to get a BA in Psychology.  I was planning on going to Grad school and do AI research.  But this was before I became disdained by the bureaucracy of the University and the self indulgence of the professors.  Who really cares about students when more research funding is the main goal.  Anyways I took my Computer Science minor and turned it into a degree as fast as possible to get away from the University.  So here I am.  Alright lets do the obligitory bio.</H4>
<P>
<H4>I was born in Phoenix and lived there until I was 17 (minus one year in Anaheim).  I went to Roadrunner, Shea, and Shadow Mountain. I then attended the University of Arizona in Tucson.  I'm now married to a wonderful woman named June.  I am also blessed with two beautiful children, Kaitlyn Michelle and Nicholas Alexander.  They are 8 and 6 respectively (I'd better not mention June's age).  We lived in Colorado Springs for a bit, where I finally got baptized on Nov. 14th, 1999.  We now reside in San Diego where I am fiddling with photogrammetry.  In my free time (like I have any) I enjoy playing my Les Paul, golfing, and goofing around with my kids.  And yes, purple is my favorite color.</H4>
